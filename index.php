<p>We started with aquiering approval to fork an existing open source project that had some of the basic functionality needed to make the website work.</p>

<p>The server was set up in a similar manor as this tutorial: <a href='https://www.cloudbooklet.com/how-to-install-lamp-apache-mysql-php-in-ubuntu-20-04/' > LAMP server tutorial</a> though with a few modifications and additions</p>
